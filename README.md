prediction house price according to the house features


Based	on	these	evaluation	metrics,	the	XGBRegressor	is	the	superior	model	for	this	regression	task.	It demonstrates	significantly	better	predictive	power	by	explaining	more	variance	and	achieving	lower error	rates	compared	to	both	Linear	Regression	and	Ridge.	This	suggests	that	the	underlying	data	might have	non-linear	relationships	that	XGBRegressor	is	better	equipped	to	capture.
